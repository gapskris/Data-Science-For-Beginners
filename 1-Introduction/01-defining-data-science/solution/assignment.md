# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Transport |One of the major challenges in transportation is reducing waiting times. Therefore, our goal is to establish a bus schedule that optimizes fuel consumption and ensures timely arrivals at bus stops.| We can collect data on passenger registrations at the bus stop station, which would allow us to determine the number of people entering the station and the waiting time they experience until the bus arrives. | We can collect the data through a web service, where batches of information are sent every hour to store the data in a database. (structured data) | We can obtain a time schedule that allows us to identify periods of longer waiting times and periods when the buses have fewer passengers, resulting in higher costs for the enterprise. Using this information, we can establish a flexible schedule based on the collected data, enabling us to predict the optimal times to dispatch buses. This approach aims to minimize both passenger waiting time and operational costs for the enterprise. |
| Sports | Explore the potential correlation between fair play and winning in a specific sport. | Achieving victories and analyzing game fouls. | We can gather data from websites containing team information and store it in a structured database. | We can ultimately determine whether there is a correlation between these two variables. Additionally, we can establish new rules for the game to promote fairness, thereby enabling fairer teams to achieve more winning games.|
| Storage Management | How can we establish an effective delivery schedule to ensure a consistent inventory level in our stores? | In order to establish an effective delivery schedule and maintain optimal inventory levels in our stores, it is crucial to gather comprehensive buying data, including the date of purchase and specific details such as promotional offers or one-time discounts.| The data can be efficiently collected and extracted from a robust accounting software that captures detailed information on sales transactions.| We can analyze and identify the products with high turnover rates, as well as those that have lower sales performance.Additionally, we can determine the optimal timing for product deliveries to ensure that we maintain adequate inventory levels and minimize the risk of running out of stock.| 

> *We provide just one answer as an example, so that you can get an idea of what is expected in this assignment.*
